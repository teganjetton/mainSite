      <h2>Who is Tegan?</h2>
      <p>I am a Full-Stack Developer and artist from Mid-Michigan. I attended Michigan State 
        University majoring in Sculpture and Painting, and minoring in Chinese Language and 
        Culture. During my time at Michigan State I discovered my love of intermedia art and 
        blurring the lines between painting, sculpture, and digital tomfoolery. I integrated 
        video, sound clips, and computer code with physical works made of metal, plaster, 
        paper, and ink.</p>

      <p>I like to problem solve and find solutions to puzzles. Not just in programming, but 
        over the years I have learned how to do my own bike maintenance and repair, repair 
        and upgrade computers, and brew a great cup of coffee. I am an avid baker and have 
        three adorable cats.</p>
      
      <p>In more recent years, I have been working at Dante's Pizzeria in Chicago, Illinois. 
        I am the go-to person for implementing any POS or online menu changes, have worked 
        every job in the restaurant, and regularly troubleshoot and solve problems both physical 
        and digital. I love my team, but I have decided to change fields. Over the last few 
        years I have been learning Full-Stack Development through Wilbur Wright College (City 
        Colleges of Chicago) and freeCodeCamp. My view on things is best described as "I can 
        figure that out," and so I have decided to invest in myself to learn and grow into the 
        exciting field of computer programming.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>Below are some of my projects. These are the website projects from freeCodeCamp. Currently, they are not perfect - but they are original. Hours spent frustrated and frantically Googling how things work so I can understand. Feel free to take a look and see how my HTML/CSS skills have improved in just a few months. Check back regularly to see new projects!</p>
