Files for my main website teganjetton.com

This repository is just meant to be a display of my website files so others
can see how I created my site. I plan to update it regularly as I add other
sections to my site (e.g. an art section I have planned).

If you happen upon this, especially if you're new to web development, feel
free to use my html/css/js as a reference to understand how I made my site. I 
feel that knowledge should be free and shared. With that said, do not steal
my work, especially if you are submitting it for a program. That's academic
dishonesty, which I do not condone.

This site was originally built to satisfy the requirements of freeCodeCamp's
capstone project for their Responsive Web Design certification. I plan to
build and grow it as my needs change.

Thanks for taking a look!
